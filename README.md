Diabetic Prediction App with Streamlit and Machine Learning

Description:
This web application leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health metrics. The backend utilizes a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and stores the trained model in a pickle file for efficient deployment. The frontend is built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for inputting patient data and receiving predictions.

Key Features:

Machine Learning Model :- Employs a robust machine learning algorithm to accurately predict diabetes risk.
Pickle File: Stores the trained model for efficient deployment and reusability.

Streamlit Frontend :- Offers an intuitive interface for data input and result visualization.

User-Friendly Design :- Provides a clear and easy-to-use experience for both healthcare professionals and patients.
